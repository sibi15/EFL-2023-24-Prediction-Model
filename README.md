# Pythagorean Expectation and Prediction of 2023/24 EFL Championship Results
Using historical match data and the Pythagorean Expectation formula, this project aimed to forecast the 2023/24 EFL Championship season outcomes, supporting better strategic decisions for clubs and analysts. The model was validated against real results from past seasons to assess prediction accuracy. This project was conducted as part of an association with the Center for Sports Analytics at Samford University.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, StatsModels, Excel, Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

Highlights:
- Modeled season standings by calculating expected points using goals scored and conceded
- Parsed and cleaned multi-season data from 2019â€“2024 across 38+ EFL teams
- Applied statistical adjustments for point deductions and administrative changes
- Validated Pythagorean model's strength by comparing real and expected standings
- Built predictive framework for ongoing 2023/24 season based on past season trends

Outcome: Demonstrated how Pythagorean Expectation can effectively approximate team performance over an EFL season, and developed a predictive tool applicable mid-season for forecasting.
